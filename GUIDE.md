# HTML5 Guide!

<b><strong><em><i><big> When i say soon, I mean... now?.... Always! Hello and welcome to the HTML5 Guide for make a website, i see you wanted to do a website like, Google! like Facebook, like Youtube, like GitHub, but sadly you don't know how to, but here is the solution of all the problems, yes, the HTML5 Guide! So i will don't talk more and start the guide!</big></i></em></strong></b>

The first thing we must do is put something different to a tag that is very important and it is the &#60;!DOCTYPE html>, yes! This is not a tag itself, it is an instruction to the browser that you are using over the HTML version in which it is written x document.

In case the curiosity comes to your house: In the version of HTML 4.01 the browser instruction &#60;!DOCTYPE html> refers to a DTD, because its version was based on SGML.

The DTD specifies the rules for the markup language, so that the browsers represent the content correctly.

By the way: SGML is the standardized generalized markup language or SGML, it is a standard for defining generalized markup languages for documents, ISO 8879 defines Annex A.1 for generalized markup.

The abbreviation SGML in English is Standard Generalized Markup Language.

The instruction for the browser so said here is the first thing that should be added to an HTML document for as we said before, define the HTML version, and after the instruction for the browser we must now put a tag that is the So familiar start of our document, eye: it is the beginning of the document not of the content of this.

The tag is extremely easy and for the whole family, it is <code> &#60;html> </code>

There are attributes that can be added in which tag, such as the language of the document, I usually use "in", now let's do a test:

<code>
&#60;!DOCTYPE html>

&#60;html lang="en">
</code>

With whose attribute we will define in the language of the document, eye: it is the language in the sense of the country, not the programming language or character language.

We return to the doubts, a true HTML document is not like that, more tags are missing! and from this doubt we can leave easily, there is a tag called <code> &#60;head></code> this as its name says it is the head of the document, and again: the tag &#60;head> is not where the content goes of the document.

Within this tag we can put another tag that is <code> &#60;title>&#60;/title> </code>

What the <title> tag does is put a title to the document apart from the name that you put, for example I call my document html: "example2.html" but I want the title to be: "Good morning!" Well look that with that tag you can do it, and for the whole family x2.

Now an example:

<code>
&#60;!DOCTYPE html>

&#60;html lang="en">
</code>

<code>
&#60;head>

&#60;title> Good Morning! </title>
</code>

Now we must close the <head> tag, but we are in another big doubt, how do we close it? Very easy my dear friend, and this goes for the whole family x3 (Ok, better I stop being so heavy with that), better we change the word, this goes for the whole document, if we want to close a tag we must "make" another tag that is <head> but this will be the one that will close it, because it is different (Wow, what a poet I am!);

Example: 

<code>
&#60;!DOCTYPE html>

&#60;html>
</code>

<code>
&#60;head>

&#60;title> Good Morning! &#60;/title>
</code>

<code>
&#60;/head>
</code>
